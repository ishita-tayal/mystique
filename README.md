A project on interfacing Python with MySQL. It is a working application titled “Mystique: Online Shopping App”. It consists of a graphical user interface which I made using the Tkinter module in Python and is connected to the MySQL database.
<br><br>
'Mystique: Online Shopping App' has been developed to allow customers to buy a variety of products from the comfort of their homes. It can be used both by customers and the admins.
<br><br>
The customer part of the application allows them to browse through products, add products to cart, order products, and see order history. Mystique also accepts a wide range of currencies.
<br><br>
The admin part of the application allows executives from Mystique to access a list of all existing customers and products. An option of searching customers and products is also available.
<br><br>
It uses the following python modules: 
<br>1. mysql.connector
<br>2. tkinter
<br>3. bcrypt
<br>4. tkcalendar
<br>5. functools
<br>6. pillow
<br>7. forex_python
<br>8. datetime
<br><br>
<b>HOW TO USE?</b><br>
1. do "pip install [for each module mentioned above]"<br>
2. install mysql and set the password as 'root'<br>
3. run project.py<br>
The username and password for the 'Mystique Executive' section are 'admin' and 'admin' respectively.
